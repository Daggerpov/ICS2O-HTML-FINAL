        <h1>Robotics Summative Website</h1>
        
        <p>This website of mine was built to explain my robotics summative. All details can be found on the website 
            itself at <a href="https://daggerpov-summative.netlify.app/">this</a> link.
        </p>

        <p>It's for this reason, that I won't be going over the materials found in that guide in this website. 
            However, I will go over its 3 pages. 
        </p>

        <h2>HOME</h2>
        <p><a href="https://daggerpov-summative.netlify.app/home.html">This</a> home page goes over what the 
            website is about since it's not a usual subject to write a summative on for the Robotics course. 
            It went over details about the website itself, and the technologies learned and went over for the 
            summative project itself. This is going to sound confusing unless you were to actually go over and 
            read it all 
        </p>
        
        <h2>WRITE-UP</h2>
        <p><a href="https://daggerpov-summative.netlify.app/write-up.html">This</a> content page is the write-up 
            itself. It includes 12 so called 'chapters' of me going over how to build a dynamic web app using different technologies 
            such as Python and Flask, to mention a couple. There are hyperlinks included at the top of the page to 
            direct you down to whichever chapter you'd like to read. You can see the layout below:

        <h2>ABOUT RAVENSCOUT</h2>
        <p><a href="https://daggerpov-summative.netlify.app/about-ravenscout.html">This</a> information page 
            goes over the robotics summative project, and our plan for the web application being built.
        </p>
        <p>This image below will show you how it looks:

        <h3>Curriculum Addition</h3>
        <p>This website of mine was actually added to the curriculum of our Robotics course on <a href="https://www.schoology.com/">Schoology</a>. 
            This being the Learning Management System used for some of the technology courses at LDH. Here is a picture 
            of it being there:

        <h3>How It's Hosted</h3>
        <p>This website is being hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> for free.</p>
