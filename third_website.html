        <h1>ICS2O My Hobby Assignment</h1>

        <p>This website was about my favorite hobby, being programming. I talked about all sorts of things 
            that was related to my relationship with programming</p>
            
        <h2>Home Page</h2>
        <p>In this page of the website, I talked about some hobbies of mine I've had in the past. I contrasted 
            those along with programming and explained why it's my favorite one. I also explained the nature of 
            how the website came about, which was to fulfill the requirements of an assignment for this course.
        </p>
        <p>It had no content other than text and looked like this: 
            <img src="./images/home page of hobby.jpg">
        </p>

        <h2>Websites/Web Applications</h2>
        <p>This page on the website is actually about the exact same thing as this one is. It went 
            over all websites and web apps I've developped. However, it didn't go into as much detail as 
            what I'm doing here. Also, it included the Robotics Scout Web App discussed in my Robotics Summative Website
        </p>
        <p>Again, this one had no content other than text, and looked like this: 
            <img src="./images/websites-webapps.jpg">
        </p>

        <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
        <p>In this web page, I pointed out how you could access <a href="https://github.com/daggerpov?tab=repositories">
            my GitHub repositories</a> and the <a href="first_website.html">1st website</a> on this page.
        </p>
        <p>What I also did, though, was talk about the technologies, including languages, that I've learned 
            in chronological order like so: 
            <img src="./images/coding experience hobby.jpg">
        </p>

        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p>Then, this last page of mine just listed my 'skills', as in the technologies/languages I've learned. 
            This was essentially done as if it were a technical resume. 
            <a href="https://daggerpov.github.io/ICS2O-HTML-MYHOBBY/my-skills.html">Here</a> is where you can find it. 
        </p>

        <h3>How It's Hosted</h3>
        <p>This website of mine is hosted by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> by using something called 
            <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for free.
        </p>
