        <h1>ICS2O Class Website for Unit 2</h1>

        <p>This website was built to go over the materials found in the
            <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csd2-2019">CSD Unit 2 - Web Development('19-'20)</a> course.
        </p>

        <h2>Borscht Recipe</h2>
        <p>For one of the assignments, we had to write a recipe of our choice in this webpage. 
            This is what it looked like:

        </p>
        <p>You can find it at <a href="https://codeprojects.org/VVeue4wzYx0iSok2Ab5mWn728kDAxwVegzst6CwRoeE/danielagapov&recipe.html" target="_blank">
            this</a> link. 
        </p>

        <h2>My Coding Experience</h2>
        <p>Here, I wrote a timeline that included everything pertaining to coding/programming since I'd started 
            last year. I included many screenshots of code I'd written, resources I'd used to learn, and more. 
            You can find it at <a href="https://codeprojects.org/VVeue4wzYx0iSok2Ab5mWn728kDAxwVegzst6CwRoeE/my-coding-experience.html" target="_blank">
            this</a> link.
        </p>
        <p>To give you a feel for what it looked like, here's a screenshot: 
            <img src="./images/my coding experience.jpg">
        </p>
        <p>This wasn't an assignment for our ICS2O course, but rather a challenge given by the online course we 
            were following on <a href="https://code.org/" target="_blank"> code.org</a>.

        <h2>My "BIG 3"</h2>
        <p>Another assignment of ours was to go over 3 of our favorite things from a certain topic, such as 
            teams in a sport. What I chose, though, was to highlight my 3 favorite programming languages. Them being:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://codeprojects.org/VVeue4wzYx0iSok2Ab5mWn728kDAxwVegzst6CwRoeE/Fav1Page.html">Python</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://codeprojects.org/VVeue4wzYx0iSok2Ab5mWn728kDAxwVegzst6CwRoeE/Fav2Page.html">JavaScript</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://codeprojects.org/VVeue4wzYx0iSok2Ab5mWn728kDAxwVegzst6CwRoeE/Fav3Page.html">HTML5</a></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Of course, though, these may have changed since making that list a couple months ago sometime in March.
